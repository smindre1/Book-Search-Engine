## Usage

- On the homepage the user can search for books, however to interact with the search result they will need to be logged into an account.
- In the top right of the page is a login/signup button. Clicking it will open a forum where the user can either signup or login.
- once logged in they may save any of the books from their searched results.
- Also, when a user is logged in, another button labeled, 'See Your Books' will appear next to the logout button (which had taken the place of the login/signup button).
- Clicking the 'See Your Books' button will load a page of the user's saved books. Each book will have a 'Remove Book' button which when clicked will remove that book from the user's saved book collection.
